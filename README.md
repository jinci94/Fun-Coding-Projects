# Fun Coding Projects
Here I will put up some "fun" code I have written, from when I have explored and tried new things (both mathematical and through different libraries). The code is mostly written in Python.

**What one can find here:**
- *Matrix* - Ascii code falling like matrix rain down the screen (green characters, black background).
- *Spinning wheel* - A spinning wheel with weights. This project was written while I explored the python GUI toolkit Tkinter (Tk interface) - the only framework that's built into the Python standard library.
